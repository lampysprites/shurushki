# Shurushki

A collection of badly maintained scripts for Aseprite with no unified purpose.

## **Installation**
1. Download this repo as a .zip using the "Code" button above. 
1. Change the extension from .zip to .aseprite-extension.
1. Double click it to install. 
1. Alternatively, in Aseprite, got to "Edit > Preferences > Extensions > Add Extension" and select the saved file.
1. Might need to restart Aseprite for menu options to appear.

## **Settings**

To keep the UI uncluttered, unneeded features can be disabled via `Help > Shuruski` (it also opens on first launch after the installation).

If something goes wrong, it might help to delete `__pref.lua` file in the installation folder. It can be found by going to "Edit > Preferences > Extensions", picking **this** extension and clicking "Open Folder" nearby. If that doesn't work, look inside [settings folder](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/preferences-folder/) (on windows, type `%APPDATA%\aseprite\extensions\shurushki` in the explorer's address bar).

## **Scripts**

### Bitmap Text (`Edit > Bitmap Text`)

Draw bitmap text using a simple bmf format used in ProMotion/GrafX2/Love2D/etc. Not to be confused with Angelcode's bmfont. An example of such font (by me) is included. Unlike ttf's, these fonts never blur, support color, and are pretty trivial to edit.

### Circular Shift (`Timeline > Cel > Right Click`)

Moves the selected cels N frames in curcular fashion. For instance, shifting cels for frames {2,3,4,5} by +1 reorders them to {5,2,3,4} in the same place. Optionally, it might apply to timings as well (affects all layers, naturally). I do that quite often to desynchronise the looping parts of the animation, or fix walk-cycle-to-idle snap.

### Draw Grid (`Edit > Draw Grid`)

Generate a grid. Supports isometric, triangular, square and diamond grids.

### Export Atlas (`File > Export Atlas`)

Combine multiple sprites to a single texture and generates .json data for the layout. Similar to spritesheet export, but can combine multiple sprites, and each layer and frame is treated separately.
**Requires** Python 3.x to be installed, along with `rectpack` package (can be installed as `python -m pip install rectpack`)

### Splice animation (`File > Splice Animation`)

Export an animation by joining tags or frames several times.

### Highlight Cels (`View > Highlight Cels`)

Makes Timeline a bit easier to navigate by finding and highlighting frames of certain duration. Also allows to highlight cels manually, even though Aseprite now added its own tools for doing so.


### Highlight Layers (`View > Highlight Layers`)
![example](readme_files/layers.png)

Highlights layers that use blending modes. Only applies to current/selected layers. You'll probably want to change the colors - mind that ase uses 0xAABBGGRR layout for colors, so e.g 0xff0044aa becomes opaque brown


### Link Active Cel / Link To All Frames (`Timeline > Cel > Right Click`)

Make the current cel linked to either the selection, or the whole timeline. Unlike the default commands, all new cels store the same frame as the current cel, not the first one. Makes working with multiple layers for the background in an animation a bit faster.

### Pattern Select (`Select > Frame Pattern`)

Select frames in a checkered order. Primary use is for dropping the frames from gifs to reduce the size (in that case, don't forget to adjust the framerate afterwards!).

### Time Stretch (`Frame > Time Stretch`)

Speed up/slow down the animation proportionally by scaling frame durations, or adding/removing a constant amount of time to them.

### Move Cels (`Edit > Move Cels`)

Move cels with a formula based on their frame time or frame number. Makes working with movement animations a little easier. 
*Example: setting `x=6 * t` will move the sprite with the speed of 6 pixels per frame. After that, calling with `x=-6 * t` does the same but to the left, thus returns the sprite to marching at place.*

### Cels To Layers (`Timeline > Cel > Right Click`)

Move each selected cel into a new separate layer. It helps, for instance, to merge several frames into one; or to open png sequence as layers. Overall, it's a weird feature that mostly satisfies author's personal preferences.

### Gamma Gradient (`Color Bar > Options > Gamma Gradient`)
![example](readme_files/gamma.png)

Generates a gradient ramp from selected colors using the equation for overlapping light.

*Note: at the moment of writing, there's no option to put it into "Sort and Gradients" menu. It works differently from the rest of the UI, and seems to inaccesibble to pluginsðŸ¤·*
